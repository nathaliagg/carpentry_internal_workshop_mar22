### Title: Statistics, Plotting and Programming in Python üêç

**Nathalia Graf-Grachet**

The material I prepared is a combination of codes found in [Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) and [Plotting and Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/). 

Additional links that I found useful: [Marker options](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/scatter_star_poly.html#sphx-glr-gallery-lines-bars-and-markers-scatter-star-poly-py), [All possible markers](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.markers.MarkerStyle.html#matplotlib.markers.MarkerStyle), [Color names](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/color/named_colors.html#sphx-glr-gallery-color-named-colors-py), [Statistical analysis](http://cleverowl.uk/2015/07/01/using-one-way-anova-and-tukeys-test-to-compare-data-sets/), [Saving plots to file](http://blog.bharatbhole.com/creating-boxplots-with-matplotlib/), [Aggregation and Grouping](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.08-aggregation-and-grouping.html), [Plotting](http://bioinformatics.igc.gulbenkian.pt/ubi/sites/bioinformatics.igc.gulbenkian.pt/files/Matplotlib_Tutorial_1.html)

### GOALS:

1. Statistical analysis consisting of an ANOVA and a Tukey test.  
2. Plot data in publication quality figures.  
3. Create an executable python script to analyze future files more efficiently.  

### Information about the data set:

Nathalia's Redemption...

This is a data set from crop science that I took from Dr. Smith's (Dep. Horticulture and Landscape) class (Spring of 2015).

The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of foliar applications of nitrogen (N) in urea form (46% N) on pecan yield and N content of leaves. ‚ÄòPawnee‚Äô was the pecan cultivar of this experiment. There were a total of three N applications, and rates were 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8% N. There wasn't much information about this unit, normally it reflects amount of N (in kg or lbs) per amount of water (in liters of gallons) used in the spray. Leaf samples were collected in July and October, and N content of leaves was determined with a Leco N analyzer. Pecans were harvested in November, and weighed. The experiment consisted of a Completely Randomized Block Design with 10 replications.
